Arizona-Sonara Desert Museum Web Map

## Application Summary
This Application is an ArcGIS JavaScript based mapping website to explore the Tucson, AZ Desert Museum. The Desert Museum is part hike, zoo, botanical garden, historical museum, and community center. My App intends to encourage the user to explore all these different parts. I also encorporate an editable "Memory" layer so users can upload Memories with photos to the public application.

## Tech Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- ESRI JavaScript 4.29 with key

## Application Features
- Encorporates many ArcGIS Online Feature Layers, some hosted by the Desert Museum, and layers digitized from the Desert Museum Illustrated PDF map and hosted by myself
- I added links to the Desert Museum Web Applications and offical website in an about section so the user can find official published content from the Desert Museum
- Use of the query function to filter the Map View and display query results in a side panel
- Use of the Editor widget to allow the user to edit a public Memory ArcGIS Online Feature Layer

## Requirements
This website application should run live on my github pages using my ESRI API key as long as my ESRI API key is still valid. If a user were to download this code, my API key would need to be replaced with another valid key. The full site uses ESRI JavaScript 4.29 with no other dependencies.

The paths that set image screenshots or layer icon references would also need to be updated.
